4. Click **"Commit changes"** → **"Commit directly to the main branch"** → **"Commit changes"**

## Step 3: Trigger the Action

Committing the file in Step 2 will **automatically trigger** the action (because of the `on: push` trigger). But you can also trigger it manually:

1. Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your repo
2. Click **"Hello Workflow"** on the left
3. Click **"Run workflow"** → **"Run workflow"**

---

## Step 4: Confirm It Ran

1. Click the **"Actions"** tab — you should see a green ✅ run at the top
2. Click into it → click the `test` job → you'll see the step named `23f3002443@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`
